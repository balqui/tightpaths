To run the tight path programs: they all need NetworkX (and maybe 
other things), some need the dataset size, check these out in file 
datasetsizes.txt if necessary.

To create graphs from datasets: ensure all the python files with import 
targets are present here, run python3 lattice.py and answer question(s).

Careful: will refuse to work if the closure of the empty set is not the
empty set, that is, if there is any item that appears in each and every 
transaction.
